# f5bot_keywords.py

This script automates the process of adding keywords to F5Bot. It supports loading keywords from a YAML file and uses a session-based approach for authentication and interaction with F5Bot's web interface.

## Features

- Automates keyword addition to F5Bot.
- Reads keywords, settings, and flags from a YAML configuration file.
- Logs in to F5Bot using credentials (from command-line arguments or environment variables).
- Handles optional configurations like enabling/disabling keywords and matching whole words.
- Implements error handling for adding keywords.
- Uses a random delay between requests to avoid overloading the server.

## Responsible Usage and Fair Use of F5Bot

**F5Bot** is a **free service** that helps users monitor mentions of keywords across various platforms. It is provided at no cost by the F5Bot creators, who dedicate their time and resources to maintain this valuable tool. 

### Use Responsibly

While this script is designed to make managing your F5Bot account easier, **it is crucial to use it responsibly**. Adding an excessive number of keywords or creating unnecessary traffic can strain F5Bot's infrastructure, negatively affecting other users and the service itself.

To prevent overloading F5Bot:
- The script includes a **random delay** (between 1 to 7 seconds) between each keyword addition. This delay reduces the risk of overwhelming F5Bot's servers with rapid requests, helping to ensure fair usage.
- Avoid adding an unreasonable number of keywords in a single session. If you need advanced functionality, consider reaching out to F5Bot for support or feature requests.

### Unfair Use Is Uncool

**Abusing F5Bot is not only unfair to its creators but also uncool.** By respecting the service and its limitations, you contribute to keeping it available and free for everyone. Let‚Äôs support free tools like F5Bot by using them ethically and responsibly. üåü
